abstract: Personalised medicine is based on the principle that each body is unique and will respond to therapies differently. In cardiology, characterising patient specific cardiovascular properties would help in personalising care. One promising approach for characterising these properties relies on performing computational analysis of multimodal imaging data. An interactive cardiac imaging environment, which can seamlessly render, manipulate, derive calculations, and otherwise prototype research activities, is therefore sought-after. We developed the Cardiac Electro-Mechanics Research Group Application (CemrgApp) as a platform with custom image processing and computer vision toolkits for applying statistical, machine learning and simulation approaches to study physiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment of the cardiovascular system. CemrgApp provides an integrated environment, where cardiac data visualisation and workflow prototyping are presented through a common graphical user interface.
